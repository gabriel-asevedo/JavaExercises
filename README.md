## About the project
Java Exercises is a set of exercises developed by me for training and improvement in the Java language with an emphasis on OOP, also addressing topics such as static members, data structure, data manipulation, memory behavior and exception handling, consequently also improving the logic of programming.

These are some of the exercises proposed in Professor **Nelio Alves**' Java course within the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) platform.

## Technologies used ðŸ’»
